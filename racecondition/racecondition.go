/*
Here, we can see that the getNumber function is setting the value of i in a separate goroutine.
 We are also returning i from the function without any knowledge of whether our goroutine has completed or not.

 So now, there are two operations that are taking place:
	The value of i is being set to 5
	The value of i is being returned from the function

	Now depending on which of these two operations completes first, our value printed will be either 0 (the default integer value) or 5.

	This is why it’s called a data race : the value returned from getNumber changes depending on which of the operations 1 or 2 finish first.
